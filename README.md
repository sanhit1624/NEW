1st open the vs code and click on terminal and run the command      "git clone https://github.com/sanhit1624/NEW"     Then using the clone the git will copy all the files into your folder which is in vs code then come to your project file repository i.e. Backend for that use "cd .\Backend\" and now run the command "npm i", so this will create "node modules" into your folder, bcoz through node modules only you'll able to do further operations, then the automatically all dependencies will get installed into your device and now on the terminal run "npm i nodemon -g" so nodemon will monitor for any changes in our source and automatically restart our server, so it is very important dependency.  Then after this create a .env file in your folder structure and copy this code -->>   
CONNECTION="mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/testvist"
PORT=8082
BUILD="view"  (one below one). 

Now for the backend connection install Mongodb compass on your laptop, dump all the bson data in your Mongodb compass correctly { First install Mongodb and then MongoDB tool, now after successful download go to Windows(c) Then to program files and then go to the MongoDB then to the server then version of 6.0 then to bin and open mongos.exe file (in this bin folder you must paste all tools files for dump) then cmd will get open and now run >show dbs then it'll show all databases, now open the new command prompt and come to file manager and copy the path of MongoDB server in bin i.e., C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\6.0\bin and in cmd paste this for file directory as by running cd.. C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\6.0\bin, you will go to the directory then run mongodump so this will create dump folder inside your bin folder, now run mongodump --db database_name, now come to the mongos.exe cmd and run show dbs this will show all database containing, it'll also contains that database_name now come to the cmd and run use database_name then it will get switched to that database and now run d.dropDatabase(), so this will drop database of database_name then on the bin path of MongoDB the dump folder will get created in that dump folder the database_name is created inside that paste all the bson data, now open the cmd and on the root file path i.e., of bin of MongoDB run mongorestore --db database_name dump/database_name now open the mongos cmd and run show dbs then you'll see the database_name is created successfully and you can open mongo compass and in that also you'll able to see that your bson data is converted successfully  }, and create a connection between your backend using MongoDB in your backend paste your connection URL of Mongodb and now in terminal do "npm start" and on browser search "localhost:8082" you'll able to see all the results.
